    <h1>My Dream Place: Snowy Mountain Under Starry Night</h1>
    <h2>Project Brief</h2>
    <p> As a native of Shanghai, I have rarely witnessed snowfall. However, I absolutely adore skiing and have always dreamed of visiting a picturesque snowy location complete with mountains and snow-covered trees. Furthermore, I am particularly fond of gazing at the starry night sky as it evokes a sense of tranquility within me. Hence, my ultimate dream destination would be a mountainous area blanketed with snow, set against a backdrop of a starry night sky.

    <h2>Interaction</h2>
    <p>The dreamland that I created had three cute snowmen, and you can popping up them around the place.
    </p>

    <h2>Process</h2>
    <p>I created this project using Unity. The overall tone and style I went for is a pixelated gaming vibe. To start, I added a button that will take you to my dreamland when clicked. Once there, you will find yourself in a snowy mountain terrain. The highlight of this terrain is the snowmen that you can interact with. Try your best to keep them popping!</p>

    <h2>Final Outcome</h2>
