    <h1>Multi-Channel Controller</h1>
    <h2>Project Description</h2>
    <p>I will create a multi-channel controller that would allow me to change various parameters in a Processing program by applying the values received from ESP32 via serial communication.

    I want my potentiometer to be used to change the color of the circle, and for the buttons to control whether or not the circle moves across the screen. This way, each time the button is pressed, the circle will appear at a random location on the screen and its color will change based on the value of the potentiometer.</p>
    
    <h2>Code Documentation</h2>
    <p>First, I need to program the ESP32 to send multiple values over serial communication.</p>

    <p>Second, I need to write a processing code that meets my need. This code maps the value of the potentiometer to a color and moves the position of the circle when the button is pressed. The color of the circle changes as the potentiometer is turned, creating a dynamic visual effect. The circle jumps to a new position on the screen when the button is pressed.</p>

    <h2>Video Demonstration</h2>
    <p>I recorded a video for my controller.</p>
