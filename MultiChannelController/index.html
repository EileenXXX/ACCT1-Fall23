    <h1>Blinkenlights</h1>
    <h2>Project Description</h2>
    <p>This project written in Arduino language controls the blinking of an LED attached to pin 21, to make the LED blink randomly like Morse code.</p>

    
    <h2>Code Documentation</h2>
    <p>The following code is written for an Arduino board. It contains two functions: setup() and loop(). 

        The setup() function is executed only once when the program starts. Its purpose is to initialize settings or pin modes. In this case, it sets pin 21 as an output pin using pinMode(21, OUTPUT).
        
        The loop() function is executed continuously after the setup() function finishes. It's the core of most Arduino programs and is used to actively control the board. 
        
        Inside the loop() function, the following steps occur: 
        
        1. The LED turns on by setting pin 21 to HIGH using digitalWrite(21, HIGH). 
        2. The program then pauses for a random duration between 100 and 1000 milliseconds (1 second), achieved with delay(random(100, 1000)). This creates a blinking effect with varying on-time durations. 
        3. Next, the LED turns off by setting pin 21 to LOW with digitalWrite(21, LOW). 
        4. Finally, the program pauses again for a random duration between 100 and 1000 milliseconds, creating a blinking effect with varying off-time durations.</p>
