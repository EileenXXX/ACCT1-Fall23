    <h1>Build for Play: Whack a Mole</h1>
    <h2>Project Brief</h2>
    <p> The game I want to create is called "Whack a Mole". The object of the game is to use a hammer to hit the moles that pop up out of their holes.For the Arduino, I want to connect 9 buttons to the 9 moles. It is really hard.

    <h2>Coding Process</h2>
    <p> First of all, I wrote the script in Arduino in order to make my 9 buttons work.

        Then, I created the game in Unity using mouse to click and whack the moles.Here is the screen recording.
